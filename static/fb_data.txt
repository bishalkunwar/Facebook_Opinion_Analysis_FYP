Why is Barnes and Nobles version of the Kindle so much more expensive than the Kindle?
@Maria:  Do you mean the Nook?  Be careful, books you buy for the Kindle are for that piece of electronics, and vice versa.  I love my Kindle, there are people that swear by the Nook.  They like the color screen.Me?  I want an ereader that is a reader-- so I dont need color.  The kindle battery lasts longer, and the unit isnt as heavy, which can make a difference after reading for a few hours. :)
kindle is awesome! mines great
I love mine!!!!
Meh. I think Singles are a bad idea. Big name authors already dominate the market by a huge factor. Now you are letting them compete on price point with indie authors (albeit giving less content for the money).
My daugjhter loves hers!
I am not sure if i just got my update but now i dont have location numbers unless i press the menu button.  But i also dont have page numbers! Am i doing something wrong?
Got a Kindle for Xmas and I love it.   Never was much of a book reader, but this has been fun.  I am on my 5th book since Christmas!
I dont have the patience for kindle singles. If Im gonna read, I need at least 200 pages.
Love the new singles ~ am reading Jodi Picoults right now while waiting till Tuesday for her new book to come out!
Not a fan of Kindle Singles.  They clog up the Kindle Book page and its tough to sort through full-legnth new releases because there are so, so many Singles there.
Best thing since sliced bread.
we love our kindles......
can anybody tell me if the FREE chapters of TICK TOC by Patterson are a summary of each chapter or the real deal....my kindle jumps 5-10 % of read with each page I read and I have real big text...thank you!
Love  my kindle, too!  Also enoyed the New York Times article...thought provoking as well kindle loving.

LOVE my Kindle..not sure if I got the update or not, though because I dont see any difference when I read. Color? I dont need color to read so Kindle is perfect. And Singles, Ive read a few, not  really a fan or not oen way or another..I just like to read so I read whatever looks interesting at the time. Did I say....LOVE my Kindle? I sure do!!
Its just too bad you arent offering these for the Original Kindle.  Seems like those of us who got on your bandwagon first are just left in the dust.
love this kindle....
